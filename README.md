This crate exists because I needed to access the [flickr](https://www.flickr.com) API and nothing was up to date.

The API is described [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).

This crate uses [`warp`](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) to receive HTTP callbacks and you can log in from the command line using it.
